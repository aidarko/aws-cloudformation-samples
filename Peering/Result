PEERING:

Idempotence: If peering is created or ip ids are changed on Request's side, then peering need to be approved and route updated on Accepter's side. 

Resources to be created on Requester side: Peering, Route

Risk: IP overlap

Pros: traffic is served within AWS => more secure, minimal pricing, less timeout

Alerting: cloudwatch, runscope test

The following are the general steps to enable service consumers to connect to your service.
Grant permissions to specific service consumers (AWS accounts, IAM users, and IAM roles) to create a connection to your endpoint service.
A service consumer that has been granted permissions creates an interface endpoint to your service, optionally in each Availability Zone in which you configured your service.
To activate the connection, accept the interface endpoint connection request. By default, connection requests must be manually accepted. However, you can configure the acceptance settings for your endpoint service so that any connection requests are automatically accepted.

Pros: internal traffic
Cons: perring, nlb are required

Public IP connection

Solution:
    - expose IGW on Kafka side
    - allow inbound traffic only for One Account's Public IP (EIP is required in case of AWS)
    - add a user to Kafka; ssl is already on

Cons: traffic leaves AWS secured zone 

Consumer: setup EIP?
